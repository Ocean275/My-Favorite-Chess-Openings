      <h1>Chess</h1>
      <p>Chess is one of the most classic games in all of history. There are many ways to start a chess game, leading to over 288 billion possible positions, after just 4 moves. In this short article, I will share with you some of my favorite openings</p>
      <h2>English Opening</h2>
      <p>The English starts with white playing 1. c4. This move does not contest the center, but rather it watches over the d5 square. From here, black has two main responses: e5 leading to the Reverse Sicilian, and c5, leading to the Symmetrical Variation.</p>
      <h3>Reverse Sicilian</h3>
      <p>After c4 and e5, white has two main options: Nc5 and d3.</p>

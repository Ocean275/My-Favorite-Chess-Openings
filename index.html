      <h1>Chess</h1>
      <p>Chess is one of the most classic games in all of history. There are many ways to start a chess game, leading to over 288 billion possible positions, after just 4 moves. In this short article, I will share with you some of my favorite openings.</p>
      <h2>English Opening</h2>
      <p>The English starts with white playing 1. c4. This move does not contest the center, but rather it watches over the d5 square. From here, black has two main responses: e5 leading to the Reverse Sicilian, and c5, leading to the Symmetrical Variation.</p>
      <h3>Reverse Sicilian</h3>
      <p>After c4 and e5, white has two main options: Nc3 and d3. After Nc5, typically black responds with Bb4, intending to ruin the pawn structure, or Nf6, reinforcing the d5 square. After d3, black responses are typically Nf6 or Bc5, continuing development.</p>
      <h3>Symmetrical Variation</h3>
      <p>After black moves c5, we once again either move Nc3, or we can move d3. Normal development continues for black, no matter what white does, Nc6 or d6. These essentially mimic each other. What black does still does not matter, and whatever move white did not do last is now played, or b3, preparing to fianchetto the bishop.</p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>The beauty of the English is that black can play any opening to counter white, and white will still develop into the position shown below. Just be sure to watch out for when black goes on the offensive.</p>
      <h2>The Caro-Kann</h2>
      The Caro-Kann is a very defensive and all-purpose opening. Although not as specialized against any particular white move, the Caro-Kann defends against e4 and d4 openings, which you will play against for 99% of your games. Assuming white plays e4 or d4, black will play c6. From here, assuming white pushes their other center pawn (if e4 then d4, if d4 then e4) black strikes into the center with d5. Depending on what white plays, we go into the Exchange Variation or the Advance Variation, both of which are self-explanatory.
      <h3>The Exchange Variation</h3>
      <p>As can be read in the name, white exchanges its e4 pawn and takes d5. Obviously black takes back xd5. From here, black now has two center pawns while white has one in a d4 opening.</p>
      <h3>The Advance Variation</h3>
      <p>Rather than exchanging the epawn, white pushes it to e5, grabbing more space in the center. Before black cements the center, Bf4 is played, developing the bishop. In this position, there really is not many other moves, as doing e3 now would block the bishop, and with the knight trapped, </p>
